ADD names to the csv file at the end after stats maybe

Do the readme

start organizing players seasons by years 

try to fix the dumb accented names

maybe go back to 60s 70s?

Add player combine stats so I can see height weight etc

redo season pulling from the get_data_frames() and only use top 10 seasons if not already
